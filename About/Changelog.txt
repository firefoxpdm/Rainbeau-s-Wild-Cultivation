  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Wild Cultivation"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 2020-03-12
    - Updated to 1.1

- 12/05/2018
	- Changed the defNames for agave seeds and for the agave seed extraction
	  recipe to match those from "Vegetable Garden," to prevent duplication if
	  both mods are in use alongside "Seeds Please!" (This will, unfortunately,
	  produce errors the first time a game is loaded in which any of the original
	  version of this mod's agave seeds exist.)

- 12/05/2018
	- Rewrote XML patches to improve load efficiency slightly.
	
- 11/03/2018
	- If this mod is used in conjunction with "Fertile Planet," rainforests and
	  tropical swamps should no longer be devoid of vegetation.
	
- 10/26/2018
	- The mod no longer adds cultivated saguaro cacti, since those can actually
	  now be cultivated in the vanilla game, anyway.
	- Fixed some problems with "Seeds Please!" seed definitions.
	
- 10/14/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld 1.0 release!
	- Removed the patches that put berries in tropical rainforests and swamps,
	  since berries now show up in those biomes anyway, and the patches were
	  generating errors that caused no plants at all to spawn....
	  
- 10/05/2018
	- Error messages should no longer be generated if other mods also patch the
	  plant files that "Wild Cultivation" patches. (At the very least, any error
	  messages that *do* show up shouldn't be this mod's fault.)
	  
- 10/03/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld b19 release.
	- Cultivated saguaro cacti are now properly treated as trees instead of as
	  plants.
	- Updated the version of the Harmony library the mod uses.
	- Removed "Mod Sync Ninja" files.

- 12/23/2017
	- It's now possible to cultivate bushes and low shrubs.
	- Plants which can be grown in planters will now display properly above
	  the planter, rather than beneath it.
	- Bryolux can now be grown in planters, if you really want planters full
	  of glowing moss.
	- Glowstools can no longer be grown in planters, as they're harvestable.

- 12/04/2017
	- The mod now works with the "Mod Sync Ninja" updater.

- 11/19/2017
	- Increased the growth speed of mushrooms to put them on a par with other
	  food crops in terms of yield over time.
	- Fixed the "Seeds Please!" seed defs for brambles and clivia bushes.

- 11/19/2017
	- Added cultivated versions of glowstools, agarilux mushrooms and bryolux.
	- Added cultivated clivia bushes and brambles.
	- Patched tropical rainforests and swamps so that raspberries and healroot
	  have a (very small) chance of showing up naturally in them.

- 11/16/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld b18 release.
	- Removed cultivated ambrosia. The fruit is supposed to be *exceedingly*
	  rare, and there's really no way to allow it to be cultivated that doesn't
	  completely throw off its balance.

- 07/30/2017
	- Saguaro cacti now require space around them, as trees do, so they can no
	  longer be sown in adjacent tiles. They also now take more work to sow.

- 06/11/2017
	- Minor XML patch improvement.

- 06/10/2017
	- "Wild Cultivation" is now fully compatible with "Seeds Please!"
	- Cultivated saguaro cacti now yield less wood than their wild cousins, in
	  addition to growing more slowly.

- 06/04/2017
	- Added "[RF]" prefix tag to the mod's name for easier mod list sorting.

- 05/26/2017
	- Improved the XML patches for better efficiency.

- 05/16/2017
	- Reduced the frequency of food crops appearing in the wild.

- 05/08/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld alpha 17.
	- The mod no longer adds wild healroot, since it's in the vanilla game.
	- The mod will automatically adjust what's harvested from wild cotton to
	  match what's harvested from cultivated cotton, to allow compatibility with
	  any of the various mods that alter cotton's harvest.

- 04/23/2017
	- The mod now uses the Harmony library instead of detouring core methods.

- 04/09/2017
	- "Wild Cultivation" is now fully compatible with "Vegetable Garden."
	
- 02/20/2017
	- Initial release.
